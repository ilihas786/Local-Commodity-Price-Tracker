# **Retail Price Analytics & Inflation Trends** 📊

A data analytics project that tracks **daily retail prices** of commodities, measures **inflation trends**, identifies **price volatility**, and detects **seasonal patterns** using historical price data.

The dataset includes current prices alongside **1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year back** prices, enabling short-term, medium-term, and long-term trend analysis.

## **Key Features**

- 📈 **Inflation Analysis** → Day-over-day, week-over-week, month-over-month, and year-over-year price changes.
- 🔍 **Volatility Detection** → Identify commodities with high price fluctuations.
- 📅 **Seasonal Trend Analysis** → Detect recurring price patterns across months and years.
- 🏆 **Top Gainers & Losers** → Rank commodities by price increase/decrease over various timeframes.
- 📊 **Visualization Dashboards** → Line charts, heatmaps, and bar plots for clear insights.
  **Forecasting** → Predict future prices using time series models (ARIMA, Prophet).

## **Tech Stack**

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- _(Optional)_ **Scikit-learn / Statsmodels** for forecasting

## **Use Cases**

- Government agencies monitoring **inflation**
- Businesses adjusting procurement strategies
- Consumers tracking price trends for informed purchasing

## Just for Analysis Purpose :

🔹 Inflation

Definition: A sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services over time.

Focus: Direction of change (upward trend in prices).

Measure: Usually measured as a percentage change in average prices between two time periods.

Example:

If onions were ₹20 last year and ₹25 this year → inflation rate = 25%.

Inflation means things are consistently getting more expensive.

🔹 Volatility

Definition: A measure of how much prices fluctuate (go up and down) over a given time period.

Focus: Stability vs instability of prices.

Measure: Usually measured using variance or standard deviation of prices.

Example:

Onion price last week: ₹20, ₹22, ₹40, ₹18, ₹35.

Average ~₹27, but price is swinging wildly → high volatility.

Rice price last week: ₹30, ₹31, ₹29, ₹30, ₹30.

Almost no change → low volatility.

🔑 Key Difference

Inflation = trend (are prices rising overall?)

Volatility = stability (are prices stable or fluctuating a lot?)

Inflation analysis → Show which commodities are becoming costlier over time (impact on cost of living).

Volatility analysis → Show which commodities are unstable (hard for consumers/farmers to plan).
